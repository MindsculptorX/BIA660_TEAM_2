In general, the flavors of the food move me as they are well-balanced in spice and texture, leaving my palate satiated at first, then wanting more. My favorites are: Kung Pao Chicken, Sechzuan pork or beef, and the Veggie medley, eaten with pints of aromatic, soft white rice. One can dine in, pick-up, or use delivery (they take cards). Service is friendly, fast, and convenient. Not only will I come back, I also highly recommend it!",Christy N.

We had the veggie pan fried dumplings, fish with sweet sauce, green beans, veggie fried rice and the Kung pao chicken.  The restaurant is very clean and the staff attentive - our food came out hot and quickly. We would go back or take out.",Julia C.

3,10/4/2017,8,1,37,dvIjT9Y1qSvnN7Moc6Ub5g,"I wasn't going to write a bad review because I think it's so rude and unfriendly to do, but after speaking on the phone with one of the employees when I called back to find out if I was overcharged on my bill, I feel I just can't not. He argued and yelled at me over the phone about what customer service is when I tried to explain the him that the business needs to inform customers when they make alterations to a price. Like in a really crazy immature weird way. Kinda shocking to encounter this type of behavior in a business setting. From reading other reviews similar to this it seems there is something really ""off"" with their understanding of how to deal with customers. (I was charged extra for altering a dish $2 more for adding broccoli, which is fine, but tell me first.. then they charged me a $1 when I asked for extra hot sauce.. yes it's petty, but still, come on.. ringing me up without telling me you are charging me more?) Unethical and almost like stealing. It's maddening when a business ignores customer service. Another person on here said he wasn't allowed to sit down and order just a tea and was treated badly by them and I can completely see this happening based on what I experienced. This pissed me off further. Be cool! Be nice. Understand your demographic.. read a book about customer service. ",Julee L.

We had paper wrapped chicken, Mushu shrimp, Kung pau shrimp, rice and hot tea Everyone thought their food was really great. I took the leftovers home, and they were even better the next day. The restaurant was very clean and the service was attentive and friendly.Would definitely return.",Penny K.
5,9/10/2017,1,1,70,LGIwmUHSGDk0WOBsSdA-gA,"Went with my daughter for a late lunch--place was pretty empty. Our server was really friendly and we ordered what he recommended--Fish with black bean and chili, beef on chinese broccoli with a Singaporean brown sauce, and then last minute my daughter added the salt and pepper pork chop. All dishes were fresh and tasty--I especially liked the fish, and who doesn't like deep fried pork with crumbly savory scallion topping? Only note is it's definitely not a Szechwan restaurant and I'm not really sure it's mandarin either.",Kathy T.
6,9/1/2017,253,3,25,QNa0gOUtbNOjmRJxPRmsWw,I love this place!! The beef a broccoli are better than your typical place. A little proxy but their quality is better than most.,Christopher V.

In all fairness for all it's worth, I believe the quality of their food has not maintained it's original flaveor and the servings have shrunk amidst having increased their prices.",Frederic S.
8,8/13/2017,5,20,7,JA4EaF8a9Uk17zs1KatedQ,"There is a big difference from east coast Chinese food and west coast Chinese food. I grew up in New York and nothing beats it but the green dragon in eaglerock comes very close. Joe and Cindy the owners know their business. I love the pork spare ribs, the chow main with crispy noodles and the service is spot on. Give it a try, you won't be sorry!",Jeremy H.

10,7/28/2017,162,75,45,gxlPbq2bmb4UsNhSQ8xStQ,"Went here for the first time today my party and I really enjoyed the food. It was very flavorful and good portion sizes to share. Prices were very reasonable as well. Would I recommend it? Yes. Was the food bomb? Yes. Why not a better rating? Well as Ive learned eating at most Asian restaurants the service Sux. I felt rushed to order our food, they never came back to ask us if we needed any drinks aside from the water & they only refilled our water because I asked them to. The friendliness was just not there but it's not a big surprise for me in Asian restaurants. Food is usually Great but service not so much.",gabriel V.

17,5/26/2017,0,0,40,eOEeAmv2ZhjYiguLvo05vA,"First visit and a good one! Had a lunch special, Hot and Sour soup among the best I've had. The spicy shredded pork, often too sweet at Americanized Chinese restaurants, was only a little on the sweet side and had a nice flavor. The accompanying egg roll was a tasty surprise. Friendly family service that was attentive but not overbearing. Wish we had something good like this on the West Side.",Ian S.
18,5/25/2017,18,0,4,2-h7O9uaMoFBRQtJgtiEZw,"Chi Dynasty in Los Feliz used to be my jam. Not anymore. Eagle Rock Green Dragon, hands down, is the best Chinese food I've ever had. Their food is fresh, clean, vibrant and full of flavor. Their dishes are authentic yet feel contemporary. It's crazy delicious. I believe it was the Chinese Chicken Salad that put Chin Chin on the map. No need to travel to Beverly Hills for their famous staple; you can get one in Eagle Rock at Green Dragon that's way better, reasonably priced and amply portioned. Even their fried fare feels healthy. My favorite dish is the House Special Lo Mein. My wife loves the Mu Shu Beef. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything is fantastic, including the friendly staff. They also deliver and, your order arrives promptly, piping hot and in solid packaging.",Cain A.
19,5/22/2017,32,123,84,b8vE9xoC2acDdmHwZYBlnQ,"Usually I turn away from Chinese Restaurants if they serve 'the free egg roll' with the lunch combos because those places tend to be Americanized. Green Dragon is definitely a step above those places. The food is delicious and they use quality ingredients. I live near by and when I'm too lazy to drive to the Asian areas (San Gabriel, Alhambra, Arcadia...) I will come here and it satisfies my cravings.",Jenine Y.

They cater to the local taste-buds(not super authentic) but often times if you ask if they can make something they will happily oblige.

Much better than the high priced Asian restaurant on Brand in Glendale. The staff is very friendly and greets you warmly when you come in. They have a very large menu with a lot of items to choose from. We have been here three times so far and ever time we order something different and have never been disappointed. Highly recommend.",Ted A.

The girl then said that I had to be a customer to get some tea so I told her that I was going to pay for it but still wouldn't let me sit down and have it. This random guy came up to me and explained to me that, ""this is a restaurant."" Okay??? Yes, I understand it's a restaurant and I just wanted to buy hot tea. They were seriously so rude.

It's definitely American Chinese, but it's American Chinese done right: not too greasy, not too salty. The Kung Pao chicken has a pretty good chicken-peanuts ratio, which not everybody gets right, and the chicken pieces are large enough that even the chopsticks-impaired, like me, can pick them up without a fork.

84,5/7/2016,4,13,44,FMmiU-3x7pCusSFGA4C_RA,Green Dragon is great. I passed by it for many years - assuming it was just another strip mall Chinese place not worth trying. Chi Dynasty in Los Feliz was my spot (the one at Americana was a disaster and closed). But after reading great reviews on GD I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised. The food is very good. It's much better to dine in or pick it up. When they deliver it's not fresh. ,Allen C.

All dishes were wonderful and tasty. The salt & pepper scallops were spicy but not hot. Really good flavor. Duck was tender and juicy and came with the black duck sauce of course.

I grabbed a menu found something I wanted and asked the lady how big their portions are and they were pretty huge for one person. My friend was outside sitting so I decided to go ask him if he wanted to share something with me, but before I went to go ask I went to go use the bathroom.... (bad idea) As I came out, two of the employees were waiting on me and swarmed up on me yelling, ""You came here to use our restroom?!"" ""Don't use our bathroom if you don't order"" I. was. shocked. I felt violated and harassed. I was totally embarrassed and definitely wasn't going to order food from them after they screamed me out their restaurant. I told them, ""I was gonna order until you guys started harassing me"" Then I through $5 dollars at the lady and told them, ""if its that serious heres $5."" I really wanted to try this place out, but what they did was so bad for their business and I will never ever eat here. I'm so disappointed and shocked with how vicious people can be in Los Angeles. I'm glad that happened because I would had never went next door to Organix it's a grocery store, but they also serve food to you too! I got the chix fingers and a barbacoa taco which was amazing!

I placed my order to-go and was pleased (after 45 minutes passing when I finally made it to my destination) that my egg roll was still crispy and delicious. The Pork was said to be one of their spicy dishes, but being a chili/hot sauce fan I still would've asked for it extra spicy. I didn't taste much of a kick from it.

We ordered the steamed and pan-friend pork dumplings, bbq pork fried rice, minced chicken lettuce cups, hot & sour soup, Szechuan shrimp and steamed vegetables. The bbq pork fried rice and shrimp dishes were probably our favorites. The filling of the dumplings was really tasty - but I would stick with the pan-fried. Too much dough for the steamed. Soup was piping hot which really hit the stop on a rainy day. The only main downside was the minced chicken lettuce cups. It was very bland and odd tasting. Just not at all what I've had other places - very dull looking too which was concerning. Would not recommend ordering that here. The waitress was super nice and was saying that wasn't her favorite dish either after we asked for our check and she noticed we didn't eat any of it almost. Service was attentive and we were seated right away (a nice change these days). Seems like a family run place, friendly staff who cares about their customers. Would definitely go back!",Sidney Z.

For $5 extra you can add on to your dinner entree and get a small cup of soup, 2 deep fried won tons, foil wrapped chicken appetizer and an egg roll. All of them were very good.

I've been to this restaurant a couple times and for the most part their food is delicious. My go to items are always lettuce cups and their pan fried noodles. I can eat pan fried noodles for days, and their house special hits the spot - especially since it's very crispy, just the way I like it. Their sweet glazed shrimp is pretty good for the first few bites, but after eating a bunch it starts to taste a tad bit sour. Eat a few other foods and return to the shrimp and you'll be in heaven once more. Trust me.",Charmaine F.

I order chicken fried rice, my daughter got veggie chow mein, and my husband got the spicy shredded beef.

But what finally sparked me to write my review was the considerate staff that called me the next day to let me know I'd forgotten my wallet on their counter after picking up my food the night before. All of my cards - and cash were there. It was much, much appreciated. Just another reason to stay a loyal customer.",Mike Y.

I went here through recommendations of friends from my church and was really impressed. I recommend the salt and pepper shrimp (with or without the shell). And the fried rice is good too! It's basically family style, order a plate - share with your table kinda thing. The part I thought was ber cute is at the end of your meal, they give you a small plate that has a almond cookie, an orange and a fortune cookie. So it's a refreshing dessert like plate for you! Good experience, friendly staff. Definitely will go again.",Ellie T.

It includes shrimp, chicken, and pork (OMG the PORK! is soooo good) No matter what you decide to order, do yourself a favor and order this fried rice as a side dish or even a main dish. You will thank me later. The Crispy Orange Chicken is a specialty and now I totally get why. It's perfectly crisp and tender at the same time. How do they do it? The Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce is very tasty and the meat is tender and cooked to perfection. Kung Pao Chicken is not too spicy but still delicious and the peanuts add a perfect crunch. They don't overload with sauce on any dishes and none of the food is greasy its just perfection! Even their white rice is amazing. ",Catherine J.

They even gave us a nicely arranged dessert plate of cut fresh oranges, almond cookies and fortune cookies. The place was neat, the tablecloth fresh and clean.

Enough good things have been said about this place so there isn't much to add.  I would give this place 4 stars if located anywhere else.

Don't get me wrong, I love the traditional Chinese Chinese food that one finds in Alhambra an San Gabriel, and make the 20-30 min drive that way usually once a week for dumplings. But on a night where you want the Chinese food that is found in the rest of America, the kind with the predictable menu with nothing you haven't heard of, Green Dragon is the place. It's not too greasy, it's not too expensive, it's just good ol' ""Chinese Food.""",Aaron S.

Out of all the dishes we ordered I enjoyed the hot and sour soup the most. The beef with orange sauce was way to sweet, and you really couldn't taste the beef. The lettuce were okay and good serving. The pan fried noodles were a big salty. If you are craving Chinese food- schezuan style and don't feel like driving to Chinatown, this place is okay.

The won tons were mushy and the broth seemed to lack flavor, however, was extremely hot upon arrival. We also ordered the honey sesame shrimp which were crispy and flavorful! In addition, we ordered the house special lo mein which not only was lacking flavor, but the shrimp inside were extremely fishy and dirty tasting, the pork (if it was even pork) had a weird distinctive flavor. Chinese food is my absolute favorite and I don't get to indulge too often because my girlfriend isn't as big of a fan as myself, I'm just so disappointed in the quality of the food and the inconsistency with the reviews.

Now, we have a NEW favorite restaurant. The food was just as delicious if not more so than Chang's. Turns out Green Dragon's chef defected from Chang's, too, so no surprise that the food was absolutely superb: very fresh and flavorful in abundant portions. Our three young sons are particularly critical of Chinese dishes, and are always comparing wherever we go to Chang's. However, from their first bites of Green Dragon's pork steamed dumplings to their last bites of sesame shrimp and all the chicken moo shoo and beef lo mein in between, they were begging to make coming to Eagle Rock for Green Dragon a new family tradition.",Lilli L.
